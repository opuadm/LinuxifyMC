# LinuxifyMC
LinuxifyMC is a Minecraft plugin that allows you to execute simulated linux commands in Minecraft.
A simulated file system is included with a database.

There are some commands that Linux doesn't have. But if you want to disable these for yourself, just run `/linuxifymc user set non-linux-commands false`.

All commands (such as help, ls, cd, etc.) can be executed using `/cli <command>`. Please note that executing `/cli` itself will just do an empty output, so use `/cli help` instead.

# Notes
This plugin does not mimic the Linux terminal perfectly, but it does give you an experience of using a linux terminal in Minecraft.

This plugin was tested only on Paper 1.21.4 for now, so using this plugin on older or newer versions may have bugs.

More things to come in the future.
